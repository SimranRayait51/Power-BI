# Customer Churn Analysis Case Study: Telecom Company
_______________________
### Background
Telco Inc. is a fictitious telecommunications company offering phone, internet, and streaming services. The company has observed a significant number of customers discontinuing their services (churning), which is hurting revenue. As a data analyst, you've been tasked with analyzing customer churn using Power BI to identify why customers are leaving and recommend retention strategies.
______________
### Objective
- **Calculate the churn rate** to quantify the problem.
- **Identify key factors** driving churn (e.g., demographics, contract types, payment methods, or services used).
- **Visualize insights** in a Power BI dashboard to support data-driven decisions by Telco Inc.'s management.
- **Provide actionable recommendations** to reduce churn based on your findings.
______________________________
### Business Questions
1. What is the overall churn rate for Telco Inc.?
2. Which customer segments (e.g., gender, age group, senior citizens) have the highest churn rates?
3. How does contract type (e.g., monthly vs. yearly) affect churn?
4. Are specific services (e.g., internet, streaming) or payment methods linked to higher churn?
5. What patterns can we infer about churn reasons based on the data?
